## Do Food outlets cluster?

A study of clustering of food outlets in two major cities (New York and Toronto) has shown that 
foot outlets cluster, with the central part of the city (Manhattan or downtown Toronto) having a distinct cluster
to other parts of the city.

The less central locations of the city show variability in which cluster of food outlets they have, 
but in New York very few adjacent boroughs have the same cluster of food outlets.

So, for those of you looking to set up a food outlet in a city location it is worth spending time
discovering where your idea would cluster to see if it fits with the local area.
